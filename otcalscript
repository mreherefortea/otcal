#The following creates a simple calculator for regular and overtime pay.

#Define the function
def computepay(h,r):
  if h > 40:
      p = 1.5 * r * (h - 40) + (40 *r)
  else:
      p = h * r
  return p

#assign our variables 
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
hr = float(hrs)
rate = input("Enter rate per hour:")
rtpr = float(rate)

#call the function computepay and assign it to the variable p.  We then print the results of computepay against hr (the float of hours) and rtpr (the float of rate)
p = computepay(hr,rtpr)
print(p)
